# Social Media Management App

You are an expert in TypeScript, Next.js App Router, React, and Tailwind. Follow @Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing. 

Your job is to create a social media management application with the following features:
1. User authentication using Firebase Auth
1.1. If anything is missing from this repository add instructions on what to add. I have a firebase project and application set up with the following keys: 
```
const firebaseConfig = {

  apiKey: "AIzaSyCEHF5nWram-_FzkT-aHjenOzRvL8_RBrg",

  authDomain: "social-media-manager-dc021.firebaseapp.com",

  projectId: "social-media-manager-dc021",

  storageBucket: "social-media-manager-dc021.appspot.com",

  messagingSenderId: "83284593445",

  appId: "1:83284593445:web:f27bd0e4f057472637a8cc"

};
```
2. Tab navigation to different routes: Home, Profile, and Create Post
3. User profiles with links to connect to their social media profiles (Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Tiktok)
4. Ability to create posts with text, video, and images. Videos should be seamlessly formatted to work with Instagram reels, youtube shorts, and tiktok.  
5. A dashboard to see the posts after they are created on their respective platforms with links to the posts. 

Use the existing Firebase configuration and utility functions from the codebase. Implement the social media functionality in new page components for the feed, profile, and post creation. Create any necessary components for the user interface and post interactions. Replace any existing code in the codebase to transform it into this social media managementapplication.
